                <p>India’s younger, media-saturated generations grow up knowing little about their country, but a lot
                    about the elites of a few metros and towns. For a narrowly-owned, commercially-driven media, the
                    dumbing down of a nation is part of standard operating procedure. Data of the Centre for
                    Media Studies (CMS, Delhi) show us that reports from New Delhi account for 66 per cent of news on
                    the front pages of major dailies. The CMS also found that in 2014-15, only about 0.24 per cent of
                    front page news came out of rural India. The TV channels are not much better.</p>

                            <p> The People’s Archive of Rural India aims to position a PARI Fellow in every single one of
                                the country’s 95 regions, most of which are untouched by the ‘national’ (read corporate)
                                media.

                            <p class="grey-text">By ‘regions’ we mean natural or historically evolved areas. For instance, in the state
                                of Uttar Pradesh we have Rohilkhand, Bundelkhand, Braj, Awadh, Sonebhadra, and Bhojpur
                                (which extends into Bihar as well).

                            Each PARI Fellow works on a specific region for a year, spending at least three months
                            full-time in fieldwork amongst the region’s people and communities.

                            Across 60 months or so, PARI will generate text reports, audio stories, videos, documentary
                            films, photographs, music and ‘talking albums’ on the everyday lives of everyday people – from
                            every part of the country. A database that will be truly representative of the Indian people,
                            particularly of 833 million rural citizens. Of their labour, crafts, stories, songs, poems, art
                            and more. The network of Fellows we build will also reflect the social composition of the
                            country. Half of the nearly 100 Fellows will be women.  And Dalit journalists,
                            Adivasi journalists and those from the minorities, will also be represented in a fair manner.
                            Many stories will be told directly by everyday people themselves. Among other legacies, this
                            will give generations of students, all our children, living textbooks on the world around them.
                            And give the nation itself a repository the like of which it has never seen.

                            PARI is a multi-lingual site. On this site you’ll find several articles which have a
                            ‘Choose language’ button at the top. Some appear in multiple languages, a few in as many as 10.
                            We intend to scale up both, the number of articles as well as languages. PARI’s audio project
                            too aims to record speakers in every one of India’s 780 living languages.
