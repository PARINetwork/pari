                            stories,
                            photos, videos and audio material going up every week on our site. It’s important that, over

                            {% blocktrans trimmed %}PARI aims to help create informative and lively stories on rural India for students,
                            teachers,
                            schools, colleges and universities. And for learners outside such formal institutions as
                            well.
                            We
                            believe teaching and learning materials, including textbooks, will increasingly move online
                            in
                            the
                            next few years. That's a process already on in some parts of the world. Done right, it could
                            mean
                            'textbooks' or teaching material that can be added to, amended, updated or widened. As
                            broadband
                            access grows, it should also mean lower costs for many students, as PARI is a
                            free-access-to-public
                            site.{% endblocktrans %}

                        <h3> {% trans "Helping students to develop course content" %} </h3>
                        <p>{% blocktrans trimmed %}We have already added a vital element to this process: on PARI, students participate in the
                            creation
                            of their own textbooks. If a teacher or an institution wants to set up learning resources
                            for a
                            course or part of a course, we will work with them to create the course content. Let’s say
                            that's on
                            rural labour or migrants or agriculture or artisans – we will try and involve the students
                            in
                            creating living knowledge on their topics through field trips.{% endblocktrans %}
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            {% blocktrans trimmed %}So videos, audio recordings, photos and text articles of and by students could not only be
                            fetching
                            them marks or grades in their courses, but also become part of a flexible and open textbook.
                            Also, a
                            video on, say, agricultural labourers where the workers themselves are the narrators, where
                            they'd
                            be addressing audiences themselves, sharing and explaining their lives, work and world –
                            that
                            will
                            make for far more compelling learning resources. These should certainly hold the attention
                            of
                            students, teachers, researchers and general viewers alike, far better than printed textbooks
                            dated
                            by some years. Especially since PARI’s approach will combine the power of text articles,
                            research
                            papers, video, audio and still photographs.{% endblocktrans %}

                            PARI
