"Can a project’s success be judged on the basis of its never being completed? "

"India is in many ways the most diverse part of the planet. Its 833 million "
"people include distinct societies speaking well over 700 languages, some of "
"them thousands of years old. The People’s Linguistic Survey of India tells "
"us the country as a whole speaks some 780 languages and uses 86 different "

"The Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India lists 22 languages whose "

"more. Three are spoken by 80 million or more. One, by close to 500 million. "
"At the other end of the spectrum are unique tribal languages spoken by as "
"few as 4,000 people, some by even less. The eastern state of Odisha alone is "
"home to around 44 tribal languages. The Linguistic Survey reckons that close "

"The use of many libraries and museums in India has fallen, more so in the "

"PARI hosts and combines video, photo, audio and text archives. There is "

"a woman agricultural labourer takes you through her life, her work, her "
"labour techniques, family, kitchen, whatever she considers important. "
"Typically, the first credit in such a film goes to her; the second to her "
"village/community. The director comes third. PARI respects her ownership of "
"her story. And it is in our mandate to search for ways in which the very "

"Roy thought the project was nuts, but loved its audacity. Drawing from a "
"(physical) photo exhibition of mine in 2011, he laid out the possibilities "
"of a fully curated photo exhibition – and more – online. We were able to use "
